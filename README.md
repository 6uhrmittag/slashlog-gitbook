# Document, Don't create

Documenting the process while creating something is important, but often neglected. This is the attempt of creating a living documentation for and about project's I started, I'm working on and that I planed.

While following tutorials and how-to's I often noticed a very limited scope - installing a tool on a clean Ubuntu is only the very first step. In software development it's even worse - writing a tool is simple. Maintaining it, supporting it and adding features is almost the more important part of the story.

During my apprenticeship I'm experiencing both sides of the story. Development of very complex software, deploying it, keeping it's infrastructure up to date **and** alive.
